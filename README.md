# Fast

```
1. yarn // install dependencies
2. yarn start // start dev server
3. yarn build // project build start
```

## Start

First of all, install the dependencies with the command: `yarn`.
Everything! Next, in the esbuild settings, change the name of the project and use the `yarn start` command - go to development!

## Build

To build the project, use the `yarn build` command.

## About the template

I tried to make this template easy to use and at the same time as flexible as possible.
`React 18.x`, `React-DOM 18.x` and `TypeScript` are installed here - enough to get you started with `React + TypeScript`, and then everything is in your hands!
